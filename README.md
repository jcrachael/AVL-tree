# About

An [AVL (Adelsen-Velsky and Landis) Tree ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) is a self-balancing binary search tree. The heights of the two child subtrees of an AVL tree differ by a threshold of 1; if at any time the heights of the two child subtrees differ by more than 1, a rebalancing occurs to restore the threshold.
